The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms
and they are often used interchangeably.  The
forms are readily interconvertable. 
The number in parenthesis refers to the length of the isoprenoid side
chain in terms of the number of carbons in
the isoprenoid side chain. These carbons occur in repeating units of
five.  Thus,
Ubiquinone(40) can also referred to as Q-8 (meaning it has 8 units
with 5 carbons each). The length of the isoprenoid side chain is
variable and genus specific." to "According to the Merck Index, ed. 11, the ubiquinones are a group of

[NUCLEOTIDE-EXCISION-REPAIR comment changed from "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a generalized DNA repair process which can repair a wide diversity of DNA lesions including UV-induced photoproducts 
(cyclobutane dimers, 6-4 photoproducts, thymine glycol), bulky adducts, apurininc/apyrimidinic (AP) sites and cross-links.  While some of these are also repaired by other pathways, 
in most cases NER is the major pathway for their repair. The nucleotide excision repair pathway consists of the following steps: recognition of the damaged area; incision 3' and 5' to 
the damaged area; excision of the damage-containing oligonucleotide; resynthesis of the excised strand and ligation to form a repaired duplex.  The main constituents of the pathway 
are the products of the genes <I>uvrA</I>, <I>uvrB</I> and <I>uvrC</I> |CITS:[ 2690930]|.  

Recognition of the damaged region is carried out in <I>E.coli</I> by UvrA which has been found to exist as a monomer in the absence of ATP but in the presence of ATP it 
forms homodimers |CITS: [3052275]|.  Its dimerization is stimulated by ATP binding but not hydrolysis |CITS:[2525700]|.  UvrA contains two ATP binding sites and three other structural motifs-- two zinc fingers and a helix-turn-helix motif, which are thought to be required for the 
proper recognition of damaged DNA substrate |CITS:[ 8444906]|.  

<I>In vitro </I> studies at physiological concentrations show that UvrA associates with UvrB to form a (UvrA2)UvrB complex in an ATP-dependent interaction |CITS: [2546148]|. 
The complex has been shown to have a higher binding affinity for damaged DNA than for undamaged DNA |CITS:[3052275]|.  Purification studies of the complex binding characteristics 
|CITS:[3024109]| suggest that the UvrA2B complex tracks along the DNA until a damage site is located. Experimental evidence |CITS: [10469667]| strongly suggests that UvrA2B 
complex possesses a helicase activity allowing it to unwind the double stranded DNA permitting access to the adduct by UvrB resulting in dynamic damage recognition and subsequent 
UvrB binding.	

UvrC protein has a high affinity for the UvrB-DNA complex (the UvrA subunits having dissociated concomitant with damage site recognition and attachment). The UvrC protein is the 
endonucleolytic component of the nucleotide excision complex and it consists of two functional  parts with the N-terminal half containing the 3' incision catalytic domain incising first 
after which the C-terminal half containing the 5' incision catalytic domain performs the second incision |CITS: [3052275]|.  An additional endonuclease (the <I>ydjQ</I> gene product-or 
Cho for UvrC Homologue) has been shown to share significant sequence homology with the N-terminal half of UvrC |CITS:[11818552]| and is capable of even more efficient 3' incision 
than UvrC, suggesting its possible role in nucleotide excision repair serving to broaden the substrate range.  

The completion of nucleotide excision repair depends upon the release of the oligonucleotide fragment along with the UvrB and UvrC proteins which are then able to be recycled to 
undertake another excision repair event.  The release of the UvrBC complex is stimulated by the presence of  DNA Pol I and UvrD.  UvrD (also known as DNA helicase II) is a single 
polypeptide with a DNA-dependent helicase activity. Studies using purified UvrD show that it unwinds duplex regions at nicks when present in sufficient concentration |CITS:[1530937]|.  
Apparently, upon incision, UvrD releases UvrC protein and the oligonucleotide strand containing the damage site leaving a complex of single-strand DNA and UvrB, which may serve to 
protect the DNA from degradation. Pol I then binds to the 3' OH terminus generated by the 5' incision and displaces the bound UvrB during resynthesis using the complementary strand 
as template |CITS:[1530937]|.  The process is completed by the action of DNA ligase.  

In <I>E. coli</I>, NER occurs at a higher rate on the transcribed strand of actively transcribed genes (compared to the non-transcribed strand of the same gene or non-transcribed regions 
of the genome.  This transcription-coupled repair activity has been ascribed to a protein called the <I>transcription-repair coupling factor</I> (TRCF) and in <I>E.coli</I> is the product of 
the <I>mfd</I> (mutation frequency decline) gene |CITS:[8244919]|.   

In summary, there are at least two modes of  nucleotide excision repair in <I>E.coli</I>.One mode does not require the coupling of repair to the transcription process and and is used for NER 
of transcriptionally silent genes and also for repair of the nontranscribed strand of transcriptionally active genes.  The second mode is virtually identical but has a specific requirement for 
a protein which can preferentially guide the NER components to regions within the transcribed strand in need of repair |CITS:[1763073|].

UvrA is one of a series of genes known as <I>SOS genes </I> which, in the event of DNA damage and other stresses, are induced to increased transcription levels. UvrA is constitutively 
expressed in <I>E.coli</I> at a level of ~ 25 molecules per cell but SOS-mediated induction of its gene increases the level to ~ 250 molecules per cell. UvrB and UvrD are also inducible by 
DNA damage. UvrC is not induced in the SOS response, however its homolog, Cho, is.

[Publications COMMENT changed from NIL to Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.]
[Protein-Features COMMENT changed from Defines a region of interest on a polypeptide to Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.

For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
can be phorphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
states: PHOSPHORYLATED and UNPHOSPHORYLATED.   The feature instance
itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
annotation label STATE with a value PHOSPHORYLATED to denote
that the residue is phosphorylated.

[Enzymatic-Reactions COMMENT changed from NIL to An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
act as cofactors, activators, and inhibitors of the catalysis of that
reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
